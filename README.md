# 👋 Hi, I'm Md Mohibbur Rahman

## 🌍 Senior Full-Stack Engineer | Backend Architect

### Open to Remote Roles (US • EU • Global)

### Laravel • React • Next.js • MySQL • DevOps

I architect and engineer **scalable, production-grade software systems** for real-world business environments.

My core expertise lies in building **robust Laravel backend architectures**, integrating them with **modern React/Next.js frontends**, optimizing **relational database performance**, and deploying through **infrastructure-aware DevOps practices**.

I specialize in systems that are not just functional — but stable under load, secure by design, and built for long-term scalability.

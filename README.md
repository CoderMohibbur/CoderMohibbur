# 👋 Hi, I'm Md Mohibbur Rahman

## 🌍 Senior Full-Stack Engineer | Backend Architect

### Laravel • React • Next.js • MySQL • DevOps

I design and engineer **scalable, production-grade software systems** used in real-world business environments.

My strength lies in combining **robust Laravel backend architecture**, **modern React/Next.js frontends**, **high-performance relational databases**, and **infrastructure-aware DevOps practices** to deliver systems that are stable, secure, and built for long-term scale.

I don’t just build features — I architect systems.
